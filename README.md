# SMS-Email_Spam_Classifier
This project is a machine learning-based spam classifier that can distinguish between "spam" and "ham" (non-spam) SMS messages. The solution uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes model and includes an interactive web application built with Streamlit for real-time message classification.
